    "2. At the time, I did not grasp the reality of the concepts that were given to us, so I underestimated the amount of trouble setting up would be. I did complete a good portion of my site, though.<br>\n",

    "1. I created a personal repository and learned how to edit it. It took me awhile to adapt to everything, but Kasm's initial malfunction allowed me to hone my problem-solving skills by ultimately leading me to seek help and watch the steps of fixing and maintaining the fixes. <br>\n",
    "2. Commits and edits were pushed to my website, not just on my local host. This step also took me awhile to figure out as well, but once I got used to it, I could commit anything. There was a setback when I would commit and not separate my steps, resulting in my commits being pulled together into one messy commit. However, I was able to learn from this mistake and group my staged commits better through to the action on my GitHub repository. <br>\n",
    "3. Inside my files with Jupyter Notebooks, I neglected to actually observe the markdown and code that was inside the initial notebooks, as well as the thorough steps to finish my own Notebook. However, I may have complicated the process more than it really was, and I learned that the reason my Notebooks weren't working was that my Jupyter extension needed to be switched to the pre-release version.<br><br>\n",

    "1. At first, I forked and cloned the wrong repository, and that set back my progress severely. I cloned portfolio_2025 instead of student_2025, and once I fixed this, my work and edits progressed more smoothly. This mistake was due to my lack of knowledge on what was actually going on, but after I fixed this, I had gained more understanding of the anatomy of Sprint 1. <br>\n",
    "2. I accomplished checking the actions pushed from VSCode and made sure that they were no errors and that the commits were deployed smoothly. There was one incident where I a faulty Notebook with faulty code messed up the rest of my commits, but once I got rid of it, my actions were fine. <br>"
