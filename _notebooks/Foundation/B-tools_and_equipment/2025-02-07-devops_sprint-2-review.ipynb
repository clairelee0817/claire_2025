    "My team's unit was 3.3.2 Data Abstraction (Variables) and JSON. I know about the contents of this lesson because I helped configure the hacks/homework assignment given, which was to find an online JSON file and to re-edit it using the variables taught in the lesson. The blog I made entails my goals and accomplishments of Sprint 2 of how my team learned to configure weighted grading and aim to thoroughly teach the lesson so that it is understandable and easy to follow. Initially, I had little prerequisites in CSP, but I consulted in online lessons as well as my teammates with more knowledge than I am to explain concepts that I didn't understand completely. Something I remembered is that I didn't know how to create a separate Python or Javascript file to complete the other teams' homeworks. Then I realized that I work on a Kasm server and I would only have to make it in my personal repository. My team's/my work consists of unique examples of coding and a unique theme color, pink. "
