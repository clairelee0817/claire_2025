    "- Data and overall information that would previously be difficult to store with manual effort are now able to be stored.\n",
    "- Important/sensitive information can be better protected with the help of databases, their easy accesibility, and strong security with authentication. <br>\n",
    "\n",

    "- Since most modern institutions such as hospitals and schools rely on an online computing system, it would be much more comprimising if a hacking incident were to occur, jeopardizing much more data than if manually stored. \n",
    "- Since computing systems such as AI are tasked to assess situations, most likely, it will lack the creativity and unique human collaboration that humans have when assessing situations. "

    "Negative effects of technology can be the overwhelming capabilities of computing systems; these systems could possibly take jobs away from people and increase unemployment rates, as well as create human dependency of these systems. To reduce these harmful impacts, there can be a balance between manual and technological strategies within all institutions and establishments that utilize this, only the manual parts can be as last resorts as to not slow down progress.
