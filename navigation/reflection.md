<h2>Sprint 1</h2>

<p><strong>Initial Goals</strong><br>
1. I wanted to be able to be able to create a page with my many personal/general photos in order to make my About page more interesting and unique. <br>
2. I thought that I would be able to finish the entire site within two weeks... <br>
3. I wanted to make my site colorful and more aesthetically pleasing. <br>

<p><strong>Accomplishments</strong><br>
1. For some reason, I'm still having trouble including my own personal photos, which I think is due to the process of changing the file type from 'heic' to another type. However, I was still able to use online photos well, and included many of them.<br>
2. At the time, I did not grasp the reality of the concepts that were given to us, so I underestimated the amount of trouble setting up would be. I did complete a good portion of my site, though.<br>
3. I was able to change my site's theme, so now it is much more clean and organized.<br>

<p><strong>VSCode</strong><br>

<p>
1. I created a personal repository and learned how to edit it. It took me awhile to adapt to everything, but Kasm's initial malfunction allowed me to hone my problem-solving skills by ultimately leading me to seek help and watch the steps of fixing and maintaining the fixes. <br>
2. Commits and edits were pushed to my website, not just on my local host. This step also took me awhile to figure out as well, but once I got used to it, I could commit anything. There was a setback when I would commit and not separate my steps, resulting in my commits being pulled together into one messy commit. However, I was able to learn from this mistake and group my staged commits better through to the action on my GitHub repository. <br>
3. Inside my files with Jupyter Notebooks, I neglected to actually observe the markdown and code that was inside the initial notebooks, as well as the thorough steps to finish my own Notebook. However, I may have complicated the process more than it really was, and I learned that the reason my Notebooks weren't working was that my Jupyter extension needed to be switched to the pre-release version.<br>
</p>

<p><strong>Github</strong>

<p>
1. At first, I forked and cloned the wrong repository, and that set back my progress severely. I cloned portfolio_2025 instead of student_2025, and once I fixed this, my work and edits progressed more smoothly. This mistake was due to my lack of knowledge on what was actually going on, but after I fixed this, I had gained more understanding of the anatomy of Sprint 1. <br>
2. I accomplished checking the actions pushed from VSCode and made sure that they were no errors and that the commits were deployed smoothly. There was one incident where I a faulty Notebook with faulty code messed up the rest of my commits, but once I got rid of it, my actions were fine.

<h2>Sprint 2</h2>

<p>
My team's unit was 3.3.2 Data Abstraction (Variables) and JSON. I know about the contents of this lesson because I helped configure the hacks/homework assignment given, which was to find an online JSON file and to re-edit it using the variables taught in the lesson. The blog I made entails my goals and accomplishments of Sprint 2 of how my team learned to configure weighted grading and aim to thoroughly teach the lesson so that it is understandable and easy to follow. Initially, I had little prerequisites in CSP, but I consulted in online lessons as well as my teammates with more knowledge than I am to explain concepts that I didn't understand completely. Something I remembered is that I didn't know how to create a separate Python or Javascript file to complete the other teams' homeworks. Then I realized that I work on a Kasm server and I would only have to make it in my personal repository. My team's/my work consists of unique examples of coding and a unique theme color, pink.
