### Sprint 1 ###

<p><strong>Initial Goals</strong><br><br>
1. I wanted to be able to be able to create a page with my many personal/general photos in order to make my About page more interesting and unique. <br><br>
2. I thought that I would be able to finish the entire site within two weeks... <br><br>
3. I wanted to make my site colorful and more aesthetically pleasing. <br><br><br>

<p><strong>Accomplishments</strong><br><br>
1. For some reason, I'm still having trouble including my own personal photos, which I think is due to the process of changing the file type from 'heic' to another type. However, I was still able to use online photos well, and included many of them.<br><br>
2. At the time, I did not grasp the reality of the concepts that were given to us, so I underestimated the amount of trouble setting up would be. I did complete a good portion of my site, though.<br><br>
3. I was able to change my site's theme, so now it is much more clean and organized.
