Hi, my name is Claire Lee. I'm 16 years old and I'm a junior. I am in Mr. Brown's P.5 class for CSP, and here are some facts about me!<br><br><br>

<p><strong>Favorite Food</strong>

<p>I have multiple favorite foods, all of which are different cuisines. I've never been a picky eater, and I was a plump kid.</p><br><br>

<p>These are my top three, though my list of favorite foods is endless. One of my dream jobs is to work in a culinary field, so I've always loved all foods since I was little, especially Korean food. </p><br><br><br>

<p><strong>Education</strong><br>

<p>For my elementary school, I first attended Monterey Ridge until 3rd grade, when I switched to Stone Ranch. Personally, I preferred Monterey because they had a garden, so I was so disappointed when I found out it got removed.</p>

<p>Then, for middle school, I attended Oak Valley MS. There, I met a lot of people who I still talk to today.</p>

<p>And now, I'm in my 3rd year of attending Del Norte HS. It's been fun, and hopefully this year will have exciting things for me!</p>

<p>Yay! You reached the end!</p>
