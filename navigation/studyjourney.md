### Big Idea 3: Algorithms and Programming

| Concept                         | Description |
|--------------------------------|-------------|
| Algorithms                      | A step-by-step process for solving a problem or performing a task. |
| Algorithmic Efficiency          | Some algorithms are more efficient than others in terms of speed or resource use. |
| Sequencing and Selection        | Programs rely on control structures like conditionals (if-else). |
| Iteration                       | Repeating code using loops simplifies solutions. |
| Abstraction in Programming      | Abstraction hides complexity and allows for code reuse. |
| Developing and Implementing Code| Programs are created through writing, testing, and refining code. |
| Events and Inputs               | Programs respond to events such as user input or sensor data. |
| Code Reuse                      | Using functions or libraries helps simplify and shorten programs. |
| Testing and Correctness         | Testing helps ensure code behaves as expected. |

### Big Idea 4: Computer Systems and Networks

| Concept                         | Description |
|--------------------------------|-------------|
| Computing Devices               | Devices input, process, and output information. |
| Hardware and Software           | Computers are made up of both hardware and software systems. |
| Internet and Routing            | The internet is a network of networks that uses protocols to communicate. |
| IP Addresses and DNS            | IP addresses identify devices; DNS translates names to IPs. |
| Packets and Protocols           | Data is broken into packets, sent, and reassembled using standardized protocols. |
| Fault Tolerance                 | Systems are designed to continue working even when parts fail. |
| Parallel and Distributed Computing | Computations can be sped up through parallel or distributed systems. |
| Cybersecurity Threats           | Security threats include viruses, phishing, and unauthorized access. |
| Encryption                      | Used to protect data in transit and storage. |

### Big Idea 5: Impact of Computing

| Concept                         | Description |
|--------------------------------|-------------|
| Computing Innovations           | Innovations can have economic, social, and cultural impacts. |
| Access and Digital Divide       | Access to computing varies among different groups and regions. |
| Legal and Ethical Implications  | Innovations must consider laws and ethics (e.g., copyright, bias). |
| Social Media and Public Opinion | Social media affects communication, behavior, and information spread. |
| Bias in Computing               | Algorithms can reflect and amplify biases in the data or creators. |
| Intellectual Property           | Respecting ownership and proper citation of digital works is important. |
| Open Source vs. Proprietary     | Different software models affect availability and usage. |
| Crowdsourcing                   | Large-scale collaboration can solve problems and collect data. |
| Environmental Impact            | Computing has both positive and negative environmental effects. |
